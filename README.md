# Data-projects-TripleTen

## Sprint 7 Project

Zomato is a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. The purpose of the project is to look at the restaurant data.
* We successfully analyzed the restaurant data set, identifying key demographics in various segments. To achieve this, we created a scatter plot to distinguish the average age of each customer’s gender and stacked bar chart to display each gender’s marital status.
* The second achievement was determining which occupation our customers belong to and their correlating income. This allowed us to then compare that data to both the average and sum of monthly sales to best identify which customer segments to pay closer attention to and track the seasonality of sales.

## Copy of Business Analytics Project

A fictional business for educational purposes.
*	We successfully pulled sales data for the superstore and identified which sub-categories generated the most sales. To support this analysis, we created a scatter plot to visualize both sales and return figures.
*	We analyzed return data by examining the number of returns per customer and their geographical distribution. Charts were used to visualize customer returns across different locations.

## Online Retail Cohort Analysis

* We funneled the Raw Data to determine how many unique customers not only added an item to their shopping cart, but how many actually purchased something.
* We then determined how many customers we retained 1-month after their first purchase over the course of a 4-month period.
